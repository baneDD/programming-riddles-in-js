# Palindrome Tester

Implement a function that checks if a string passed to it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same from left to right and from right to left. Examples of palindromes are "racecar", "madam" and "120021". 

These are the rules:

- An empty string passed in should return false
- A string with a single character should return true
- Comparison should be case sensitive
- Spaces between words can be ignored
- Any non alphanumeric characters can be ignored
