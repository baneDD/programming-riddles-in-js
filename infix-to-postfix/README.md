# Postfix Notation

Implement a parser that reads an infix string and converts it to Postfix notation. The operators can be +, -, *, /, and ^ with standard precedence rules and left-associativity of all operators but ^. Operands will be single digit numbers from 0 to 9. Input can contain parentheses but they will always be in the correct order.
